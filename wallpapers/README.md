# Wallpapers

This directory holds wallpapers of amazing artists. It acts as a source to bootstrap my wallpapers on newly created systems and also to keep track of the artist list.

## Original artwork

Almost all the images are downloaded directly from [Pixiv](https://www.pixiv.net). You can find the artist, and also the original artwork by going to 'https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/{{ file name without "_p0" }}'.

Some exceptions are listed below:

- [766340.png](/766340.png) is from 'Afterschool of the 5th Year' artbook of artist [Kantoku](https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/1565632)
- [718203.png](/718203.png) was taken from [Kyouou Ena](https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/4608546) but the Pixiv link is now broken
- [tomori.jpg](/tomori.jpg) is a screenshot taken from the anime [Charlotte](https://charlotte.fandom.com/wiki/Charlotte_Wiki)
